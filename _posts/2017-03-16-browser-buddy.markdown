Today, I would like to introduce the `Browser Buddy` Google Chrome
extension. `Browser Buddy` can be installed
from [here][browser-buddy-link].

For those of you who have been following this blog, you will know that
I have been working on this project for a little while now. This post
is the first time I have been able to package up my `Article
Credibility Profiler` into a useful tool that can accompany you while
you browse.

I have given it the tagline "Your personal guide to the web", as I see
`Browser Buddy` as a tour guide while we browse. It is not there to
make decisions for us, or to tell us when an article is right or
wrong, true or false. Rather, it is here to provide us with insights
that are not always obvious at first glance. 

It is my hope that through the use of this guide, some of you might
feel a little more informed, and therefore confident, during your
daily web browsing activity.
