As some of you may know, I have built a Chrome Extension called
`Sadblock` recently. You can check it out [here][sadblock-link].

It is at its core a plugin that will hide sad/depressing posts on
various social media platforms. It can also hide politics and a few
others, with more on the way.

The need for a tool like Sadblock is not isolated to a small group. We
can verify this through seeing posts like [this one][imgur-post-link]
popping up fairly regularly. Often, the people that most desire a tool
like Sadblock are the ones that would never ask for it. The reason is
likely for fear of seeing things like this:

I would like these sileneced people especially to understand that they
are definitely not the only ones that are tired of going to bed
depressed, or waking up and having your morning ruined because
everyone else wants to talk incessantly about heartbreaking news. 

I get a lot of flak from people questioning the intent of the tool,
with the claim that it amounts to giving someone blinders, and "how
will they stay informed?" The fact is, sad stories will appear on the
news, google, messaging, blogs, at the water cooler, talking to
friends and parents, etc. Take a moment here, and really try to
understand that if news is truly newsworthy, sad or otherwise, it will
find its way to you. It always does.

It is not necessary to be bombarded with news about terrorists and
deaths halfway across the world in order to "stay informed". All that
happens is someone goes to bed with a sinking feeling in their
stomach, or they wake up and have their day ruined because the first
thing they read in the morning is that another person lost their life
in some tragic way.

Maybe Sadblock will at least delay this until after breakfast. That
seems worthwhile, no?

It's simple. It's free. It works.

Stay happy, friends.
