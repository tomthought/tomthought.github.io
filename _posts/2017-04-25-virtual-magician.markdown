As a fun weekend project, I decided to do something a little
different. I built a webapp that I ended up calling "The Virtual
Magician", and you can check it out at [thevirtualmagician.com][virtual-magician].
The Virtual Magician will guess a number or word you're thinking of
using a few tricks. Or rather, magic.

I would explain how it works here, but that takes away from the
experience I think. I've included some instructions at the end of the
game that you can follow if you're curious enough to figure out how it
works.

Enjoy!
