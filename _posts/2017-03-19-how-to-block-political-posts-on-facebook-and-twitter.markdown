This year is shaping up to be a rough one on social media. Well over
50% of the posts I'm seeing on my Twitter and Facebook these days are
political by some measure. Solving this problem seemed like a natural
fit for [Sadblock][sadblock-link], so I decided to add a keyword pack
just for this scenario.

Steps to hide political posts on Facebook and Twitter:
1. Install [Sadblock Chrome Extension][sadblock-ex-link].
2. Navigate to [Facebook][fb-url] or [Twitter][tw-url].
3. Click Sadblock icon in top-right corner.
4. Enable "Politics" category.
5. Enjoy a more pleasant online experience!

Some Chrome extensions already exist to sort of solve this problem,
but they are often overly complex, and limited to one social media
site. [Sadblock][sadblock-link] is dead-simple to use, all the
keywords are done for you, and it works on Facebook, Twitter and
Reddit (with more coming soon).

Happy browsing!
